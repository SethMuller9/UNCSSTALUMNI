# UNCSSTALUMNI
This page is designed to connect UNCSST alum, help them plan trips together, and keep up to date on how the undergraduate team is doing. 

This page is created by Seth Muller. I was a member of the UNC Ski Team at its conception, and it was the most impactful and rewarding organization I participated in while at school. I've gone on to become an avid ski mountaineer and private Cert 1 Ski Instructor in the Colorado Rockies.
